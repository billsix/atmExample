 ./build.sh       
   - Bash shell script which compiles the code, drops and creates the postgresql schemas, and runs the tests
 ./dist.sh        
   - Bash schell script which does all of the steps of build.sh, but also creates the executable JAR files and deployable WAR file
 ./api            
   - The domain model and interfaces for the service and data access layers
 ./implementation 
   - Implementations of the service and data access layers
 ./richClient     
   - The Swing rich client GUI for the application
 ./webClient      
   - The JSF webpage GUI for the application
 ./implementation/target/ATM-implementation-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   - After running dist.sh, this is the executable which runs the service layer, domain model, and data access layer, exposing them via RMI
 ./richClient/target/ATM-richClient-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   - After running dist.sh, this is the executable which runs GUI that connects to the service layer via RMI
 ./webClient/target/ATM-webClient.war
   - After running dist.sh, this is the executable which gets deployed on your JavaEE 5 application server
